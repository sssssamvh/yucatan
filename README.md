# Yucatan

This Python package is a random collection of tools I've written over the years, as and when they came in handy. There's no guarantee that they'll always (if ever) be useful to anyone else. Let alone be bug-free, so no guarantees!

## Installation

1. Place the `yucatan` folder inside a directory which is included in Maya's PYTHONPATH. This you can edit by setting `PYTHONPATH = C:\MyMayaPythonScripts;` in your version's Maya.env file. The `yucatan` folder should in this case be located inside the `MyMayaPythonScripts` folder.
1. In the Python command line (bottom left, you may have to switch from MEL), enter `import yucatan`. The toolbox should be available in the menu bar now. This can easily be turned into a shelf button.
